        <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
    <p>The main issue in being able to live and sustain a healthy life, 
        is peoples’ addiction to eating junk food. The lack of awareness on the repercussions of
         unhealthy intakes (such as excessive amounts 
        of carbohydrates, sugars and saturated fats) is what leads to diseases like 
        diabetes, obesity, heart disease and even specific cancers. Furthermore, this is known to exceed 
        a point where their tardiness on any means of exercise increases significantly. This problem is not only 
        affecting Singapore, but also the world, and with limits in place to combat the pandemic too, people’s
         movement outside their houses have been restricted.Around 18% of the deaths every year are due to heart disease, 
        and there is an estimate of about 20,000 deaths every year in Singapore.
